# aaa

The goal of aaa is to help compute the probability of geometric distribution.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
## basic example code
# The probability of having the first success on the kth attempt with a probability p of succeeding on any one try.
library(aaa)
k=11
p=0.2
probability=Geometric(k, p)
probability
```
