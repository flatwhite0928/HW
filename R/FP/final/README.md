The aim of this project is to collect the profiles of NBA players available on the wiki. Since it takes time to connect to websites, I only choose the first 50 NBA player on the list to shorten the time. It obtain information from the wikipedia, clean them, combine them, summarize them and export as rds file. The variables includes Name, nationality, born, year, High school, college, height, weight, NBA draft, etc.
