library(RMySQL)
# Connection
witch_con <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(),
      dbname = "witchcraft",
      host = "tbrambor.cqejfaflibld.us-east-2.rds.amazonaws.com",
      port = 3306,
      user = "student",
      password = "mds-is-fun")
```
## 1.

```{sql connection=witch_con}
SHOW TABLES
```
```{sql connection=witch_con}
DESCRIBE accused
```
```{sql connection=witch_con}
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM accused
```
```{sql connection=witch_con}
SELECT firstname, sex, age
FROM accused
LIMIT 5
```
```{sql connection=witch_con}
SELECT COUNT(age)
FROM accused
WHERE age>0
```
```{sql connection=witch_con}
SELECT DISTINCT occupation
FROM accused
```
## 2.
```{sql connection=witch_con}
SELECT DISTINCT devil_type
FROM devilappearance
```
```{sql connection=witch_con}
SELECT COUNT(devil_text)
FROM devilappearance
WHERE devil_text LIKE '%black%'
```
```{sql connection=witch_con}
SELECT COUNT(devil_type)
FROM devilappearance
```
```{sql connection=witch_con}
SELECT COUNT(devil_type)
FROM devilappearance
WHERE devil_type = 'Male'
```
the proportion of 'male' in devil_type is ```250/396```
```{sql connection=witch_con}
SELECT COUNT(devil_type)
FROM devilappearance
WHERE devil_type LIKE '%Male%'
```
the proportion of male devil is ```291/396```
I am not sure whether devil_types like 'Male Fairy' meet the requirement. So I check both of the situations.

## 3.

```{sql connection=witch_con}
SELECT AVG(female_accusers), AVG(male_accusers), MAX(female_accusers), MAX(male_accusers)
FROM trial
```
```{sql connection=witch_con}
SELECT sentence, COUNT(sentence) AS 'count of diffrent sentences'
FROM trial
WHERE sentence LIKE '_%'
GROUP BY sentence
ORDER BY COUNT(sentence) DESC
```
```{sql connection=witch_con}
SELECT verdict, AVG(female_accusers+male_accusers) AS 'average number of accusers for diffrent verdict'
FROM trial
WHERE verdict LIKE '_%'
GROUP BY verdict
ORDER BY AVG(female_accusers+male_accusers) DESC
```
